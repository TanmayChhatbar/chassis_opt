# TODO

- truss_sim.m
  - visualize external and internal forces
  - validate/verify calculation of internal forces
  - calculate deformation due to forces
  - plot deformation due to the forces
  - introduce mass as forces?
  - discretize members?
- introduce beam parameters
- calculate factor of safety
- show stress concentration points
- make cost function for optimization
- code no-go zones for members for optimization as constraints
- code hard pickup points for certain members
- enlist test loading conditions
